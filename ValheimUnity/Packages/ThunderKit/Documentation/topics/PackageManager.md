The [ThunderKit Package Manager](menulink://Tools/ThunderKit/Packages) can be opened from the main menu under Tools/ThunderKit/Packages

With the package manager you can access mods, mod loaders, and utilites hosted on Thunderstore and other mod distribution sources in the future to assist you in making your project.

ThunderKit will automatically locate and download any dependencies for the packages you install.

ThunderKit works partially off the Unity Package Manager, if you'd like to learn more about the Unity Package Manager review the [Unity Manual - Packages](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/PackagesList.html) section.
